    "# Motivation\n",
    "I was motivated to do this project because I have a keen interest in the home values of King's County Washington... Oh wait, that's a complete lie. I am doing this project because I am required to review data related to King's County housing, scrub the data, do some analysis, and develop a regression model. With that said, there is a great deal of data available and I am interested in going through a full analysis without being \"walked through\" the process. I believe that doing this project will give me an idea of my strengths and weaknesses as this stage of my learning as well as give me practice applying data science concepts in Python."
